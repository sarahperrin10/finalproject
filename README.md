###  The Most Popular Shows on Netflix by State, Extended
![Sarah Perrin](images/titlepage.png?raw=true "Sarah Perrin")

For this project, I wanted to create an interactive graphic based on data I found regarding the most popular shows on Netflix by state. This data, compiled by HighSpeedInternet.com, was found by using Google Trends to determine the most searched Netflix shows. 

My piece begins with a title page that introduces my topic (“The Most Popular Shows on Netflix by State”) and then gives directions to move onto the next scene (to press the right arrow key). The next scene is a computer screen that gives the user directions on how to interact with my piece (they must click on each state abbreviation). The final scene is a large, green On-button (like on a remote control) that links to the interactive map.

In order to see the data on the map, the user must click on the state's abbreviation on the map with their mouse. This will then display the image of the show and the show's name in the middle of the screen inside a television. They will jitter like static on a screen. In addition, I have taken out the cursor on the map and replaced it with a cartoon remote control instead. On the top of the screen, there is a link back to the title page, and a link to my source (HighSpeedInternet.com) I implemented the grey background behind the map to mirror a "static television," or white noise. Aesthetically, I tried to follow Netflix's color scheme of red and black. I imported a font from Google Fonts that I also thought matched this theme. 

My piece is laid out easily for user interaction. None of the abbreviations are crowded on others, the image and show name are displayed clearly in the middle of the screen, and the user has to only click once to see this information, and click again to get rid of it. My intended audience is mostly teenagers and young adults, those who most often watch Netflix. Though it’s not a serious topic, it is still interesting information to absorb and interact with. I also think this is a graphic that Netflix as a corporation itself, or even the shows depicted here, would find useful for understanding their market and what regions of the country different shows succeed in over others. Overall, I think the interactions in my piece have updated the original graphic on HighSpeedInternet.com to a degree that my project now better matches the formidable essence of Netflix, both as a brand and as a consumer product.
